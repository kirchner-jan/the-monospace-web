# A quick one while he's away

## TL;DR: deep reflections on names and identity, life-changing decisions, and mental renovations. And all of that in ~500 words!

My earliest best friend from school is named Jan. Later in high school, three out of four people in my group of closest friends were also called Jan. In university, I had three flatmates whose name was, I kid you not, also Jan[1](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-1-62384184). We all had middle names that we used to differentiate ourselves, so throughout my childhood and teenage years, I was always called Jan _Hendrik_. It was very weird for me when I moved further south and people called me _just_ Jan because there were no other Jans around. I almost felt [like I was missing something](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/25#:~:text=\(Back%20in%20the%20old%20days%2C%20whenever%20magical%20identical%20twins%20were%20born%2C%20it%20had%20been%20the%20custom%20to%20kill%20one%20of%20them%20after%20birth.\)).

Why am I bringing this up? No particular reason.

Let's put the punchline first: A few weeks ago, I joined the [Alignment Team](https://openai.com/alignment/) at OpenAI! ðŸŽ‰ Everything is super exciting, and everybody is super nice to me! I'm working remotely now, but I hope to move to the bay area soon. Moving to the bay [appears to be a very hip thing among EAs](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M5GoKkWtBKEGMCFHn/what-s-the-theory-of-change-of-come-to-the-bay-over-the), so Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting as many interesting people as possible.

I have a great story to tell about how this new job came about, involving me teaching myself how to code in the hope of building an AI, reading about the [AI box experiment](https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox), and studying brains to understand how cognition comes about. But I'm not a big fan of personal mythologies[2](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-2-62384184), so I'll admit that I simply got seduced[3](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-3-62384184) by one of the most interesting[4](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-4-62384184) problems out there. And Iâ€™m pretty happy about getting to work on that full-time.

My new job is also why I've been uncharacteristically quiet for the last two weeks on this Substack. The problem is not that I am "too busy to write". I have [previously professed my belief](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/slightly-advanced-decision-theory?s=w) that I want to do _**all the things**_ to maximize positive impact[5](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-5-62384184). I havenâ€™t changed my mind about that; the problem is that there is currently a lot of "renovation" going on in my head. I'm moving a lot of neuroscience knowledge from working memory to my cerebral basement, and I'm doing a _lot_ of updates on all kinds of beliefs. I _am_ working on some more posts, and I have more collaborations in the pipeline, but I'm running out of swap space very fast[6](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-6-62384184).

So, _Iâ€™ll be back,_ etc etc[7](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-quick-one-while-hes-away#footnote-7-62384184)! The [IAN](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/making-of-ian)niversary is coming up, I want to write some retrospective on my PhD, and there is a post on Hebbian learning and the covariance rule that feels relevant for [modularity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JzTfKrgC7Lfz3zcwM/theories-of-modularity-in-the-biological-literature). Iâ€™m [not ready to stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6IBDpYr8aw&ab_channel=GildasSaynac).

Oh, and I've always wanted to say this, but it never made sense before. But now I can. Ahem: _The views expressed on this blog are my own and do not represent the views of my employer._ Wow, that felt good.

The stories we tell ourselves about why we do what we do are probably largely just that - stories.

And the one way I feel comfortable claiming similarities between Scott Alexander and me is when [he describes how he ](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously)_[cannot](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously)_[ stop](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously).

Now I realize that the previous paragraph _is_ just a roundabout way of saying, "I'm too busy to write "... Oh well ðŸ˜„ I _am_ optimistic about returning to my previous schedule.
