# An Ominous OMEN

## TL;DR: A collaboration with my friend Mathieu where we finetune a language model on his YouTube persona.

My good friend Mathieu has this YouTube channel where he makes science communication videos about (mostly) Marine biology. I admire the care he puts into each and every video of his, so when he asked if I wanted to collaborate on one I didn’t hesitate.

There isn’t a lot of technical novelty beyond what I already did with [IAN](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/making-of-ian), but it’s definitely fun to see what a YouTube creator can do with a fine-tuned language model.

Also, what a visual firework!
