An audio version of “[Soldiers, Scouts, and Albatrosses](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses)”. Writing long-form is fun, but reading a long post every week is perhaps a bit much. So now you can also just listen to my voice read out the posts! I plan to release these slightly more frequently than the written essays so that I catch up eventually. Also, no worries about getting flooded with notifications about this. For the next audio releases, I won’t send an email to everyone about it. You _can_ however get notifications for audio releases on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vHVA4oHPEnt3AqJF6WB64) or [Apple Music](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-brains-minds-and-their-possible-uses/id1617525316).
